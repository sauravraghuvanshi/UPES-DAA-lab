O(n^c): Time complexity of nested loops is equal to the number of times the innermost statement is executed. For example the following sample loops have O(n2) time complexity

  
   for (int i = 1; i <=n; i += c) {
       for (int j = 1; j <=n; j += c) {
          // some O(1) expressions
       }
   }

   for (int i = n; i > 0; i -= c) {
       for (int j = i+1; j <=n; j += c) {
          // some O(1) expressions
   }
For example Selection sort and Insertion Sort have O(n2) time complexity.
