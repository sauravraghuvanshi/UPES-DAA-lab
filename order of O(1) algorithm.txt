O(1): Time complexity of a function (or set of statements) is considered as O(1) if it doesn’t contain loop, recursion and call to any other non-constant time function.

   // set of non-recursive and non-loop statements

For example swap() function has O(1) time complexity.
A loop or recursion that runs a constant number of times is also considered as O(1). 
For example the following loop is O(1). 

// Here c is a constant   
   for (int i = 1; i <= c; i++) {  
        // some O(1) expressions
   }
